Hello! I'm Mia Lee, a curious soul passionate about building things with code. Currently, I work as a frontend developer.

On this blog, I document my learning path.

When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring local museums, hiking, reading, or playing whith childrens.

Feel free to reach out to me on via greenday232333@gmail.com—I'm always happy to connect!
